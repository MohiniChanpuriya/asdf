        Is Stranger Things for kids?<br>
        We'd say no when it comes to kids under 10 watching Stranger Things 4.<br> It's scary and not kid-friendly in the least!<br> And we'd highly suggest waiting for your children<br> to be 12 and older before letting them watch this season.<br> TV-14 seems a pretty good rating for this one.</p><br>

             <br>"Locke & Key" worth watching?<br>
             Yes! It was written by the son of Stephen King!<br> The characters are interesting and engaging.<br>Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez Locke & Key tells the story of the Locke siblings,<br> Tyler, Kinsey, and little Bode, who, along with their mother,<br> return to their ancestral home of Keyhouse following<br> their father's gruesome murder.</p><br>
